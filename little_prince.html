As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
<u> I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</u>
<span style="background-color:orange ;"> It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
<span style="color:red ;"> <strong>"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</strong></span> As his lips opened slightly
with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: <span style="color:red ;"> <strong>"What moves me so deeply, about this little
prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his
whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep. . ."</strong></span> And I felt him to be more fragile still.
<u>I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be exstinguished by a little
puff of wind. . .</u>
